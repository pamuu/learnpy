2. assignment operators on lists does copy by reference
3. arguments to functions are by referece
4. to copy an array : array[:]
5. to get last element of array: array[-1] (array[-2] for second last and so on)
6. python has both positional, keyword arguments and support default argments (like in php)
7. optional, arbitary and default arguments should be placed at last for positional arguments (obviously!)
8. Why are you reading this Arjun?
9. Importing : import module_name , usage: module_name.function(), import module_name as mn (alias)
10. alt import : from module_name import function_name , usage function_name()
11. alias  : from module_name import function_name as fn , usage fn()
12. import all functions from module_name import *
13. '''Docsctring''' used to describe a function, immediately after the declaration
14. If you specify a default,keyword value for a parameter, no spaces should be used on either side of the equal sign
15. If your program or module has more than one function, you can sepa- rate each by two blank lines
16. All import statements should be written at the beginning of a file. The only exception is if you use comments at the beginning of your file to describe the overall program.
